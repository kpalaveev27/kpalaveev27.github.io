            <p>Kiril Palaveev is a director and photographer from Seattle, Washington. Growing up he remembers playing his favorite movies over and over again, trying to pull as much meaning from them as possible. He hopes that his art can provide that same experience to people, and make them feel as if there is another world in the frame. He currently attends Emerson College and is working to receive a BA in Visual Media Arts production. He lives in Los Angeles.</p>
